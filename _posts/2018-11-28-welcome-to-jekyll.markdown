Welcome! We are a diverse group of polyamorous folks, many of whom are queer, and all of whom have varied backgrounds. We help to lead a community in Portland, OR and want to provide access to resources for as many people as we can. In our experience, talking about terms, issues, and experiences help us grow and be more mindful and loving in our daily lives. We’ll be publishing episodes very soon, and we’re very excited to have conversations about topics that you bring to us! Feel free to send us a question on our Facebook page. If you leave us a voicemail, we might play it on the show! Talk to you soon!
