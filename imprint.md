# Who sits at the Poly Round Table?

Welcome! We are a diverse group of polyamorous folks, many of whom are queer, and all of whom have varied backgrounds. We help to lead a community in Portland, OR and want to provide access to resources for as many people as we can. In our experience, talking about terms, issues, and experiences help us grow and be more mindful and loving in our daily lives. We’ll be publishing episodes very soon, and we’re very excited to have conversations about topics that you bring to us! Feel free to send us a question on our Facebook page. If you leave us a voicemail, we might play it on the show! Talk to you soon!

## Podcaster: Auyrn

I’m Auryn. I’m gender nonbinary, relationship egalitarian style polyamorous, polysexual, and I use they/them pronouns; though you might hear she/her occasionally as well. I’ve been practicing polyamory in various forms for almost seven years at the start of this podcast. I first started down this path with a partner who was very hierarchical and rules-based, but once that ended I started down a path of self advocacy and independence where I learned to be more relationship egalitarian, boundaries based, and true to myself.


## Podcaster: David

I’m David, I’ve been part of the local polyamory community for four years and exploring non-monogamy for seven years. Polyamory has allowed me to fit my needs and wants within an ethical framework that was previously unavailable to me. It’s given me the structure and framework for living a happy and fulfilling life.

## Podcaster: Dustin

I’m here because after a few relationships and learning about Polyamory, it seemed to make sense for me to think about relationships differently. I’ve been non-monogamous for 1 year, and feel that I can’t go back to how I was raised to relationship. I’ve always had difficulty being part of something, and never felt like I truly fit in anywhere. Which is why I like non-monogamy, it’s my own unique version of how I can interact with people. I believe that balance in many things is key to relationships, and there’s always a lot to learn as people change.

## Podcaster: Emily

I’m Emily.  I’m female, Bi/Pan/Polysexual, and have never really grokked monogamy.  Over the years I have tentatively identified with aspects of Relationship Anarchy, Solo Poly, and Aromanticism, I think all mostly as a way of parsing through my distaste for Amatonormativity.  My current, and possibly eternal, quest, is to try to find an answer to the question: What even is romance, anyway?

## Producer: Keith

I’m Keith. I’m a cis-man, and I identify as monoga-mish. I, myself, prefer one partner but am perfectly fine if my partner is poly. I find ethical non-monogamy to be a life style that helps people grow and provides a framework for relationships that may not have been seemingly available before. I enjoy helping individuals discover this lifestyle. I also appreciate the open communication and personal developmental growth the poly community provides
